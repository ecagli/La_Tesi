\section{Introduction to Cryptography}
The terms \emph{Cryptography} (from the Greek \emph{krypt\`os} (secret) and \emph{graphein} (writing)) and \emph{Cryptanalysis}, denotes two branches of a science named \emph{Cryptology}, or \emph{science of the secret}. Cryptography initially refers to the art of \emph{encrypting} messages, which means writing meaningful messages in such a way to appear nonsense to anyone unaware of the encryption process. In general, cryptography aims to construct protocols to secure communication, while cryptanalysis studies the resistance of cryptographic techniques, developing \emph{attacks} to break the cryptosystems' security claims. These two complementary domains evolve in parallels, since the evolution of attack techniques allows conceiving more resistant cryptographic algorithms, and inversely the resistance of such algorithms requires the conception of more sophisticated attacks.\\

The art of cryptography is very ancient, probably as ancient as the language, but only the development of information technology made cryptology take the shape of a proper science, sometimes referred to as \emph{Modern cryptology}. The last be seen as a branch of different disciplines, such as applied mathematics, computer science, electrical engineering, and communication science. Modern cryptosystems exploit algorithms based on mathematical tools and are implemented as computer programs, or electronic circuits. Their goal is to provide security functionality for communications that use \emph{insecure channels}, for example the internet. In particular, modern cryptosystems are designed in order to ensure at least one of the four following information security properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item[a.] \emph{confidentiality}: the transmitted message must be readable only by a chosen pool of authorized entities;
\item[b.] \emph{authenticity}: the receiver can verify the identity of the sender of a message;
\item[c.] \emph{non-repudiation}: the sender of a message cannot deny having sent the message afterwards;
\item[d.] \emph{data integrity}: the receiver can be convinced that the message has not been corrupted during the transmission.


\end{itemize} 

Two branches of cryptography may be distinguished: the \emph{symmetric cryptography} and the \emph{asymmetric cryptography}. The first one historically appeared before and is based on the hypothesis that the two communicating entities share a common secret, or private key; for this reason this is also called \emph{secret key cryptography}. The second one, introduced around 1970, allows any entity to encrypt a message in such a way that only a unique chosen other entity could decrypt it; this is also called \emph{public key cryptography}. \\

A general principle in cryptography, nowadays widely accepted by cryptography researchers, is the one given by Kerckhoff in in 19th century: it states that cryptosystems should be secure even if everything about the system, except the key, is public knowledge. Following this principle, today many industrials and governmental agencies exploit for their security services cryptosystems based over standardized algorithms. Such algorithms are of public domain, thus have been tested and tried to be broken by a large amount of people, before, during and after the standardization process. Resistance to many attempts of attacks is actually the strengths of standard algorithms.\\

In the following part of this section a description of the two standard cryptographic primitives, \emph{i.e.} building block algorithms used to build cryptographic protocols, that will be used in this thesis will; a symmetric one, the AES, and an asymmetric one, the RSA. 
\subsection{Description of AES}
The \emph{Advanced Encryption Standard} (AES) has been standardized in 2001 by the United States governmental agency \emph{National Institute of Standards and Technology} (NIST) through the \emph{Federal Information
Processing Standards Publication 197 } (FIPS PUB 197) \cite{nist197}. It is a symmetric encryption algorithm

As we have seen in the previous section, modern cryptography proposes solutions to secure communications that asks for electronic computations and repose their security over some secret keys. Keys are
