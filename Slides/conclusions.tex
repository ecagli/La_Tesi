\begin{itemize}
\item A wide part of Side-Channel litterature consider leakages localised in small and known portions of signal
\item In practical contexte, curse of dimensionality affects the potential optimality of profiling attacks
\item In many applicative domains Machine Learning solutions are used to tackle it
\item Profiling attacks $\approx$ classification task
\item Generative model approach:
\begin{itemize}
\item Classification-oriented techniques for dimensionality reduction 
\item LDA and KDA generalization to tackle masking countermeasure
\end{itemize}
\item Discriminative model approach:
\begin{itemize}
\item Neural Networks, big data scalability
\item CNN to integrate resynchronization in a unique model construction process
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{block}{Today and in the future}
\begin{itemize}
\item ASCAD database and SCA/DL community
\item From CNN to PoIs, visualizing techniques
\item Advanced-attack-oriented machine learning task (instead of multiple classification)
\item Collision attacks $\approx$ verification task (siamese network)
\end{itemize}
